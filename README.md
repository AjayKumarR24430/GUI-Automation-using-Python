## GUI Automation using Python

### Steps:
1. Use libraries( python or any language comfortable) to automate GUI. 
2. On running the script, the user should be able to navigate between screens and produce some click events, basic gesture( swipe or for visibility, select and area) and keyboard events. 
3. Hard code coordinates of UI at those positions you want to implement. 
4. A sample flow could be:
    From desktop screen -> This PC -> Create a rectangular area of selected pixels ->
    Downloads directory in explore -> Open any text file and type a text, hello World.
